  "R3 stable (shared-store fleet ops): multi-tenant durable outer loop.

   Pure data — no threads, no network. Models the durable loop described in
   the actor design (lease / tick / budget / governor / crash recovery):

     1 tick = 1 bounded guest run (call-main or run-report)
     lease  = who may run which guest until when
     budget = remaining fuel / llm / http quota for a tenant
     checkpoint = EDN-serializable recovery snapshot

   Execution still calls into kototama.tender on the JVM host; this ns only
   owns the *scheduling and recovery contract*. Not Raft consensus — see
   docs/maturity.md R3."
