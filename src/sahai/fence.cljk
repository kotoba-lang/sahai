  "Cross-node lease fencing skeleton (not Raft/Paxos).

   Pure data rules so multiple recovery daemons can share a checkpoint store
   without double-running the same tenant/guest:

   - Each lease carries :kototama.fleet/epoch (monotonic generation).
   - fence-key = [tenant guest] — identity of the work unit.
   - Higher epoch always wins. Equal epoch → later issued-at; then owner id.
   - claim-or-renew: take ownership if free/expired/higher epoch; refuse if
     another owner holds a live equal-or-higher epoch.

   Does NOT implement network consensus, leader election, or clock sync.
   Nodes must share wall-clock roughly and a shared store (disk NFS / B2)."
